# C Projects

This repository is a collection of my C programming projects. It includes a range of programs and implementations that I’ve built for learning, practice, and exploration of core C concepts.

## What's Inside

- **Algorithms** – Sorting, searching, recursion, and basic algorithm implementations.
- **Data Structures** – Linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, and more.
- **File I/O** – Projects that read/write data from files, demonstrating C's file handling features.
- **System Programming** – Memory management, pointers, and other low-level programming tasks.
- **Mini Projects** – Small utilities, games, and practice programs.

Each project is contained in its own folder with source files and a `README` (if needed) explaining its purpose and how to compile/run it.

## Goals

- Practice writing efficient and clean C code
- Reinforce understanding of core programming principles
- Build a personal reference of reusable code
- Explore low-level systems concepts

## How to Use

You can explore the folders to find projects of interest. Most can be compiled using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
